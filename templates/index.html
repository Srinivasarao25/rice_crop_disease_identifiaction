            <h2>About Rice Crop</h2>
            <p>Rice is one of the most important staple foods, feeding billions of people worldwide. It is grown in a variety of climates, primarily in Asia, where it accounts for the bulk of global production. Rice cultivation requires suitable temperature, water, and soil conditions. However, rice crops are susceptible to several diseases that can significantly impact yield and quality.</p>
            <p>Common diseases affecting rice include bacterial leaf blast, brown spot, and various fungal infections. These diseases can be detrimental to crop health, and early identification is crucial for effective disease management and crop protection.</p>
            <p>Our Rice Leaf Disease Identifier uses advanced machine learning models to predict the type of disease based on leaf images, helping farmers and researchers identify diseases early and take preventive measures.</p>
